[intro and comparison to SEA neighbours]
[brief history of poverty reduction efforts]
[current efforts in poverty reduction]

The Philippines, home to over 7,600 islands and a growing population of 113 million, has poverty reduction on its mind. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr hopes to decrease the country's poverty rate to 9% by the end of his term in 2028 through a mix of economic assistance and social development programs targetting the country's poorest populations. In 2021, the year of the most recent official data, the current poverty rate of the country stands at 18.1%. With four years to go to achieve this goal [continue here] 

<!-- average poverty rate by region -->
The Philippines is split into three major island groups from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The National Capital Region (NCR) contains the capital Manila and 16 other cities and municipalities. The poverty rate is defined as the share of poor Filipinos whose income per person is insufficient to meet their basic needs. Average poverty rate by major island group follows the reverse pattern from top to bottom; Mindanao records the highest poverty rate, followed by Visayas, Luzon (excluding the NCR), with the NCR boasting the lowest poverty rate. The average for the entire country cuts through the middle (see chart).

From 2015 to 2018, all major island groups recorded decreases in poverty rates. The impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased poverty rates in the country as a whole and in Luzon, Visayas, and the NCR, from 2018 to 2021 (see chart). Mindanao is the only island group that saw a constant decrease in poverty over the three years of data. However it still records the highest poverty rate among the major island groups in the country and the order has not changed over time.

<!-- urban/rural poverty -->
At the regional level, stark differences are reflected between urban and rural areas. In 2021, rural poverty exceeds urban poverty rates in 15 of the 17 regions. Among the 17 regions, only 4 have urban poverty rates below the national average - all based in Luzon. 

Across regions in Visayas and Mindanao urban poverty rates exceed the national average and only one region (Region VI) records a rural poverty rate below the national average. 

All regions in Visayas and Mindanao record urban poverty rates above the national value while 8 of the 9 regions between the two island groups record rural poverty rates

[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_renaming) contains a (incomplete) list of significant country name changes from the 1500s to present day. Changing names is not an easy task as there are a lot of factors to consider. Does currency need to be reprinted? What about names of established institutions? Rebranding can be costly, but is often done out of necessity. 

Name changes can occur due to countries splitting, such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s or the break-up of Yugoslavia. Renaming is also an act of decolonization: around 31 ex-European colonies changed their names from 1940 to 1980 upon independence. 

The Republic of TÃ¼rkiye is the latest country to officially change its name, previously known as The Republic of Turkey. Recently, The Republic of India used "Bharat" to refer to itself in dinner invitations to G20 members. Perhaps there will be a new name to remember.

## Reflections

There are a lot of packages to facilitate scraping in R. This also gave me a chance to brush up on my HTML/XPath skills that I picked up during my studies. Scraping a simple list from Wikipedia was not too challenging; I think the most difficult part of this task was re-structuring and cleaning the text data into a neat and usable format.
