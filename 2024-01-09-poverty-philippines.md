The Philippines, a populous island nation in Southeast Asia, has ambitious goals for poverty reduction. By 2028 President Ferdinand Marcos Jr aims to [decrease](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Philippine-poverty-rate-drops-to-22.4-still-far-from-Marcos-target) the country's poverty rate to 9% as his presidential term ends. In line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the country aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. A susceptibility to environmental and global shocks, coupled with [high food inflation](neda.gov.ph/ph-records-lowest-inflation-rate-in-2023-govt-to-continue-measures-to-protect-filipino-purchasing-power-neda/), and a history of conflict has stalled progress in the Philippines. 

From 2012 to 2021 (the most recent year of data) the Philippines' national poverty rate dropped from 25.2% to 18.1% (see chart 1), still above the country's [target](https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/statdev/press-release) between 15.5-17.5%. This was accomplished through various social welfare policies such as [cash transfer programs](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/programs/conditional-cash-transfer/), community driven development, and improvements to livelihood and [employment opportunities]((https://www.lumina.com.ph/news-and-blogs/blogs/social-welfare-programs-in-the-philippines/)) for the most vulnerable populations. 

<!-- average poverty rate by region -->
The Philippines is split into three major island groups from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The National Capital Region (NCR) contains the capital Manila and 16 other cities and municipalities. The national poverty rate is defined as the share of poor Filipinos whose income per person is insufficient to meet their basic needs. Poverty rate by major island group follows the reverse pattern from top to bottom: Mindanao records the highest poverty rate, followed by Visayas, Luzon (excluding the NCR), and the NCR recording the lowest values (see chart 2). The overall poverty rate cuts through the middle.

From 2015 to 2018, all major island groups recorded decreases in poverty rates. The impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased poverty rates in the country as a whole and in Luzon, Visayas, and the NCR, from 2018 to 2021. Mindanao is the only island group that saw a constant decrease in poverty over the three years of data. However, it still records the highest poverty rate among the major island groups in the country and the order has not changed over time.

<!-- urban/rural poverty -->
1. Poverty is quite rural: rural rates exceed urban in 15/17 regions
2. Long term improvements to minimize urban poverty are required. Only 4/17 regions fall below the national average.
3. Poverty rates in more agriculture, forestry-related regional economies are higher 
4. The difference in urban/rural in Visayas and Mindanao are relatively large compared to those in Luzon

Three patterns show the stark nature of the urban-rural poverty divide in the Philippines. First, rural poverty is higher than urban poverty in 15 out of 16 regions (the NCR has no rural areas). Regions in Mindanao, which are predominantly agriculture and fishing-based economies, record some of the largest rural poverty rates in the country that exceed the national value. 

Second, the majority of urban poverty rates exceeds the national value, including all regions in Visayas and Mindanao. Regions in these two island groups are 

Finally, the differences in urban and rural poverty in regions of Visayas and Mindanao are relatively large compared to those in Luzon. The difference in urban and rural poverty rates in 7 out of the 9 total regions in Visayas and Mindanao are higher than Luzon's largest difference (Region V has a 10 percentage point difference). Region IX in Mindanao has the largest difference in urban and rural poverty rates in the country (27 percentage points). 

<!-- need to conclude on poverty programs and where to go -->
The Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 outlines the Marcos administration's ambitious goals to reduce poverty through economic growth. It recognizes the multidimensional nature of poverty and the need to tackle it from different sides: improved education for children, health outcomes for all, modernizing and improving agricultural efficiency to name a few. Eyes are set on the 9% target but getting there is an uphill battle.  

+ health outcomes for all
+ improving infrastructure and urban and rural links facilitates better access to markets and economic opportunities [pdp 15]
+ addressing environmental factors (air quality, heat, green spaces) and health outcomes  
is expected to help poor populations in urban areas
