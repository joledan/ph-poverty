[brief history of poverty reduction efforts]
[current efforts in poverty reduction]

The Philippines, home to over 7,600 islands and a growing population of 113 million, has poverty reduction on its mind. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr hopes to decrease the country's poverty rate to 9% by the end of his term in 2028 through a mix of economic assistance and social development programs targetting the country's poorest populations. In 2021, the year of the most recent official data, the current poverty rate of the country stands at 18.1%. With four years to go to achieve this goal [continue here] 

<!-- average poverty rate by region -->
The Philippines is split into three major island groups from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The National Capital Region (NCR) contains the capital Manila along with 16 other cities and municipalities. The poverty rate is defined as the share of poor Filipinos whose income per person is insufficient to meet their basic needs. Average poverty rate by region follows the reverse pattern from top to bottom; Mindanao records the highest poverty rate, followed by Visayas, Luzon (excluding the NCR), with the NCR boasting the lowest poverty rate. The average for the entire country cuts through the middle (see chart).

Mindanao's poverty rate, on average, consistently decreased over the three years of data. The remaining regions follow a similar decrease in poverty rates but only from 2015 to 2018, as they increased going into 2021. Policy makers attribute this increase to the economic shutdown caused by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Estimates suggest that [x] amount of Filipinos were pushed into poverty as a result. 
Over the three years of data, the order remains the same from top to bottom. 

<!-- urban/rural poverty -->
At the regional level, differences in poverty rates between urban and rural areas are stark. In 2021, rural poverty exceeds urban poverty rates in 15 of the 17 regions.

The majority of regions in Visayas and Mindanao have large differences between urban and rural poverty rates (see Region IX). 

Among the 17 regions, only 3 have urban poverty rates below the national average. Rural poverty rates in Visayas and Midnanao exceed the national average.

[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_renaming) contains a (incomplete) list of significant country name changes from the 1500s to present day. Changing names is not an easy task as there are a lot of factors to consider. Does currency need to be reprinted? What about names of established institutions? Rebranding can be costly, but is often done out of necessity. 

Name changes can occur due to countries splitting, such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s or the break-up of Yugoslavia. Renaming is also an act of decolonization: around 31 ex-European colonies changed their names from 1940 to 1980 upon independence. 

The Republic of TÃ¼rkiye is the latest country to officially change its name, previously known as The Republic of Turkey. Recently, The Republic of India used "Bharat" to refer to itself in dinner invitations to G20 members. Perhaps there will be a new name to remember.

## Reflections

There are a lot of packages to facilitate scraping in R. This also gave me a chance to brush up on my HTML/XPath skills that I picked up during my studies. Scraping a simple list from Wikipedia was not too challenging; I think the most difficult part of this task was re-structuring and cleaning the text data into a neat and usable format.
